# The Game of Squava

## Rules

Squava is a tic-tac-toe variant. Moves are made like tic-tac-toe, except on a
5x5 grid of cells. Players alternate marking cells, conventionally with `X` or
`O`.  Four cells of the same mark in a row (verical, horizontal or diagonal)
wins for the player with that mark. Three cells in a row loses. That is, a
player can win outright, or lose.

You can [play the JavaScript version](https://rawgit.com/bediger4000/squava/master/squava.html) right now!

The rules have an ambiguity, in that it isn't clear what to do if a single marker
fills in a row of 3, say, and a diagonal of 4. Does that player win or lose?

I chose "win", mainly because it's computationally easier to check for 4-in-a-row
as a win separately from 3-in-a-row as a loss. After all, every 4-in-a-row has
3-in-a-row inside it.

## Golang Program

Command line, text interface.  `squava` (the program) command line options:

      -C    Computer takes first move
      -D    Play deterministically
      -H    Human takes first move (default true)
      -M string
            Tell computer to make this first move (x,y)
      -d int
            maximum lookahead depth (default 10)
      -n    Don't print board, just emit moves
      -r    Randomize bias scores
      -B    Computer opens from a "book", first or second move

The multithreaded version adds:

  -N Use this many threads (default 4)

Alpha-Beta minimax, [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
from Wikipedia. Since more than one move can result in the maximum numerical score,
`squava` keeps a list of all moves that have that maximum numerical score, and chooses
one at random to actually play. The `-D` flag will skip the choice, and always play
the same move in identical situations.

The lookahead (number of moves ahead the code considers) varies during the game.
If less than 8 marks appear on the board, it looks ahead 4 moves (2 moves each for both players).
If less than 13 marks appear on the board, it looks ahead 3 moves for each player.
If more than 12 marks appear, it looks ahead 5 moves for each player.
This is something I set by trial and error. I set the lookahead to as large
a number as I could stand to wait for. If the human plays right in the first few moves
when the program isn't looking too far ahead, the human can win.

The threaded (goroutined) version has a simple worker pool design.
It starts a number of goroutines that block on a buffered channel
of pointers-to-game-state. When the program needs to decide on a move,
it makes one game-state struct for each possible move it can make.
The game-state structs go into the buffered channel. Each worker
goroutine gets a game-state struct, does the alpha-beta minimaxing
for a single move, and puts the result on another buffered channel.
The main goroutine waits for results and chooses the maximum-valued
move to play.

### Book

Every good alpha-beta minimax program has a "book" for the initial moves.
I've included some programs to help build a "book" for `squava`:

`opening2` can perform a very deep valuation of the 6 cells that are unique first moves.
There's 25 empty cells at the start of a game. All but 6 first moves can be generated by rotations
or reflections of the board.

`opening3` can perform very deep evaluations of all 6 first moves, and all unique (under rotation
and reflection) response moves. This lets me check which response is best for each opening move.

![First move values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bediger4000/squava/master/1move.png)

*First move values to first player, 14 ply lookahead*

I think that the scores get assigned based on the lookahead finding situations like this:

        0 1 2 3 4
     0  _ _ _ _ _ 
     1  _ O _ X O 
     2  _ X X _ _ 
     3  _ _ _ _ _ 
     4  _ O _ _ _ 

The human moved first (using 'O' marks), and moves went like this:

1. 1,1
2. 2,2
3. 1,4
4. 1,3
5. 4,1
6. 2,1

That's a reasonably good opening for 'O'. Depending on how 'X' plays, 'O' can
have 3 possible 4-in-a-rows. In this particular game, the computer (playing 'X')
predicts it will lose. The first 3 'X' moves put it in a situation where it can't
move to (0,4), (3,1), (2,0), (0,4), (2,3) without creating 3-in-a-row and losing.

A diagonal 4-in-a-row for 'O' exists between (4,1) and (1,4). 'X' cannot move to (2,3)
without losing. Next move for 'O' should be (3,2). 'X' next move is immaterial, and 'O'
wins with (2,3).

Counting reflections, there's 16 triangles like 'O' made above, 4 for each corner of
the board. All 3 vertices of the triangles end up on high-valued cells of the first
move diagram above.

You can counter your opponent in the early moves of a game to prevent formation of
a triangle trap. The computer's static evaluation function doesn't look far
enough ahead in the games first 4 moves to avoid getting caught in a triangle in
a later phase of the game.

Experimentation leads me to believe that the best first moves are (1,1),
(1,3), (3,3) and (3,1). The worst first move is (2,2), the center of the board,
followed by (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (4,2).

### Static Valuation Function

After reaching its lookahead depth (which varies throughout the game) the code
does a static valuation of the board - it assigns a numerical value to the
layout of X's and O's.  By default, the static value has a slight bias towards
moves at the corners of the board, and a slight bias towards winning (or
forcing a loss) in as few moves as possible.

![Slight bias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bediger4000/squava/master/staticval.png)

*Default bias - reflect to get all cells' bias*

Using the `-r` flag causes the program to give a random bias, from -5 to 5 for each
cell. Using `-r` can cause the program to vary its opening moves, and give the human
a small advantage.

After the slight biases, it gives larger magnitude scores for having
a non-losing any 3 out of a winnning 4-in-a-row combination.

It gives a large negative score for the computer losing by 3-in-a-row, or by
human winnning.  It gives a large positive score for for computer winning, or
human losing by 3-in-a-row.

Experimentally, considering 2-of-loosing-3 does not make a difference in
the program's play.  I think this is because every winning 4-in-a-row
stems from a losing 3-in-a-row created two moves before.

There are some configurations it should avoid, but doesn't. Two adjacent marks
flanked by empty cells means that player cannot play either of the empty cells
without losing. It should probably take this into account.

Other than tic-tac-toe, where it's feasible to check the entire game tree
on every move, this is the first static valuation function I've written
that actually produces a worthwhile opponent, and it's also quite simple.

## Building the Golang programs

    go build squava.go
    go build squavathr.go  # Multi-goroutine version
    go build sns.go
    go build playoff5.go

`squava` will execute an Alpha-Beta minimax search for the best move. `sns` will execute
a [NegaScout](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/downloads/qian_search.pdf) search.

## Running the Golang programs

`sns` and `squava` behave mostly identically.

    $ ./squava
    Your move:

to have the computer use a "book" opening:

    $ ./squava -B
    Using opening book
    My move: 1 1
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _ 
    1  _ X _ _ _ 
    2  _ _ _ _ _ 
    3  _ _ _ _ _ 
    4  _ _ _ _ _ 


You enter 2 digits in the range 0 to 4, with a space or spaces between them.
The computer ponders, announces its move, and displays the board. Human plays
'O', computer plays 'X'.

You can have the computer go first:

    ./sns -C
	My move: 0 0 (30) [2800381]
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  X _ _ _ _
    1  _ _ _ _ _
    2  _ _ _ _ _
    3  _ _ _ _ _
    4  _ _ _ _ _
    Your move:

`sns` chose the cell at <0,0>, which had a value of 30, and visited 2,800,381 leaf nodes
of the game tree to arrive at that move.

You can force the computer to choose a particular opening move:

    ./squava -M 1,1
    My move: 1 1
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _ 
    1  _ X _ _ _ 
    2  _ _ _ _ _ 
    3  _ _ _ _ _ 
    4  _ _ _ _ _ 


I find that a typical game has two phases: opening, where there's up to 5
pieces on the board.  A midgame, where you try to win by getting 4-in-a-row,
while keeping the computer from getting 4-in-a-row. Rarely, you can get to a
third phase, an end game, where no 4-in-a-row is possible, and the goal becomes
to avoid losing by being forced into 3-in-a-row.

You can see the end game taking place by running two instances of `squava` in
two `xterms`. Start one as `./squava -C`. It will chose a move first. Type
that move into the second instance, which expects the "human" to move first.

25-move games are possible. As near as I can tell 'O' (second player) always
wins those full-board games. I don't have a proof for this yet.

The `playoff5` program allows you to run instances of two algorithms against
each other:

    $ ./playoff5
    AlphaBeta <3,3> (18) [95864]
    NegaScout <4,0> (5) [4134847]
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _ 
    1  _ _ _ _ _ 
    2  _ _ _ _ _ 
    3  _ _ _ X _ 
    4  O _ _ _ _ 
    
    AlphaBeta <3,1> (99) [184528]
    NegaScout <2,4> (30) [1377241]
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _ 
    1  _ _ _ _ _ 
    2  _ _ _ _ O 
    3  _ X _ X _ 
    4  O _ _ _ _ 
    ...

The AlphaBeta instance almost always wins. You can play off two of the same algorithm, or
order them differently:

    $  ./playoff5 -1 N -2 A
    NegaScout <3,2> (30) [2800381]
    AlphaBeta <2,1> (-8) [405536]
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _ 
    1  _ _ _ _ _ 
    2  _ O _ _ _ 
    3  _ _ X _ _ 
    4  _ _ _ _ _ 
    ...

You can specify what the first player is (`-1 x`) and what the second
player is (`-2 x`). The 3 options are 'A' for an alpha/beta minimaxing
player, 'N' for a Negascout minimaxing player, and 'B' for an alpha/beta
minimaxing player that has an opening for its first 3 moves
