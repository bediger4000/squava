# The Game of Squava

## Rules

Squava is a tic-tac-toe variant. Moves are made like tic-tac-toe, except on a
5x5 grid of cells. Players alternate marking cells, conventionally with `X` or
`O`.  Four cells of the same mark in a row (verical, horizontal or diagonal)
wins for the player with that mark. Three cells in a row loses. That is, a
player can win outright, or lose.

You can [play the JavaScript version](https://rawgit.com/bediger4000/squava/master/squava.html) right now!

The rules have an ambiguity, in that it isn't clear what to do if a single marker
fills in a row of 3, say, and a diagonal of 4. Does that player win or lose?

I chose "win", mainly because it's computationally easier to check for 4-in-a-row
as a win separately from 3-in-a-row as a loss. After all, every 4-in-a-row has
3-in-a-row inside it.

## Golang Program

Command line, text interface.  `squava` (the program) command line options:

      -C    Computer takes first move
      -D    Play deterministically
      -H    Human takes first move (default true)
      -M string
            Tell computer to make this first move (x,y)
      -d int
            maximum lookahead depth (default 10)
      -n    Don't print board, just emit moves
      -r    Randomize bias scores


Alpha-Beta minimax, [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
from Wikipedia. Since more than one move can result in the maximum numerical score,
`squava` keeps a list of all moves that have that maximum numerical score, and chooses
one at random to actually play. The `-D` flag will skip the choice, and always play
the same move in identical situations.

The lookahead (number of moves ahead the code considers) varies during the game.
If less than 8 marks appear on the board, it looks ahead 4 moves (2 moves each for both players).
If less than 13 marks appear on the board, it looks ahead 3 moves for each player.
If more than 12 marks appear, it looks ahead 5 moves for each player.
This is something I set by trial and error. I set the lookahead to as large
a number as I could stand to wait for. If the human plays right in the first few moves
when the program isn't looking too far ahead, the human can win.

### Book

Every good alpha-beta minimax program has a "book" for the initial moves.
I've included some programs to help build a "book" for `squava`:

`opening2` can performa very deep valuation of the 6 cells that are unique first moves.
There's 25 empty cells at the start of a game. All but 6 first moves can be generated by rotations
or reflections of the board.

`opening3` can perform very deep evaluations of all 6 first moves, and all unique (under rotation
and reflection) response moves. This lets me check which response is best for each opening move.

*First move values to first player, 14 ply lookahead*

### Static Valuation Function

After reaching its lookahead depth (which varies throughout the game) the
code does a static valuation of the board - it assigns a numerical value
to the layout of X's and O's.
By default, the static value has a slight bias towards moves at the corners of the
board, and a slight bias towards winning (or forcing a loss) in as few moves as possible.

![Slight bias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bediger4000/squava/master/staticval.png)

*Default bias - reflect to get all cells' bias*

Using the `-r` flag causes the program to give a random bias, from -5 to 5 for each
cell. Using `-r` can cause the program to vary its opening moves, and give the human
a small advantage.

After the slight biases, it gives larger magnitude scores for having
a non-losing any 3 out of a winnning 4-in-a-row combination.

It gives a large negative score for the computer losing by 3-in-a-row, or by
human winnning.  It gives a large positive score for for computer winning, or
human losing by 3-in-a-row.

Experimentally, considering 2-of-loosing-3 does not make a difference in
the program's play.  I think this is because every winning 4-in-a-row
stems from a losing 3-in-a-row created two moves before.

There are some configurations it should avoid, but doesn't. Two adjacent marks
flanked by empty cells means that player cannot play either of the empty cells
without losing. It should probably take this into account.

Other than tic-tac-toe, where it's feasible to check the entire game tree
on every move, this is the first static valuation function I've written
that actually produces a worthwhile opponent, and it's also quite simple.

## Building the Golang program

    go build squava.go

## Running the Golang program

    ./squava
    Your move:

You enter 2 digits in the range 0 to 4, with a space or spaces between them.
The computer ponders, announces its move, and displays the board. Human plays
'O', computer plays 'X'.

You can have the computer go first:

    ./squava -C
	My move: 2 2
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _
    1  _ _ _ _ _
    2  _ _ X _ _
    3  _ _ _ _ _
    4  _ _ _ _ _
    Your move:

You can force the computer to choose a particular opening move:

    ./squava -M 1,1
    My move: 1 1
       0 1 2 3 4
    0  _ _ _ _ _ 
    1  _ X _ _ _ 
    2  _ _ _ _ _ 
    3  _ _ _ _ _ 
    4  _ _ _ _ _ 


I find that a typical game has two phases: opening, where there's up to 5
pieces on the board.  A midgame, where you try to win by getting 4-in-a-row,
while keeping the computer from getting 4-in-a-row. Rarely, you can get to a
third phase, an end game, where no 4-in-a-row is possible, and the goal becomes
to avoid losing by being forced into 3-in-a-row.

You can see the end game taking place by running two instances of `squava` in
two `xterms`. Start one as `./squava -C`. It will chose a move first. Type
that move into the second instance, which expects the "human" to move first.
